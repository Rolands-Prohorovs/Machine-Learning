**For SEUL project I am gonna try two methodes: interviews and observational research methode.**
**Because project is almost done, in my opinion, this will be best methode.**
**I will try to find where user struggle, what user can't find or do intuitively.**

I will ask my friend to do these things on website:
- register:  
    - on login page, when you press create account, you are througn to get started page and you need to chose create account again. 
    - On get started page big create profile icon is not button but have movement like it 
    - not possible to input email while registering
    - registering process is completely wrong, token is not cleaned
    - registering doen't require password
- register with google: 
    - good
 - edit profile:
    - good
 - logout:
    - good
 - login: okay

 - create team:
    - picture is too large for backend, 
 - join team:
    - works fine
 - edit team:
    - not possiable to edit team

 
## I will check out process, how they will do it, and where go.
 **Then I will ask these questions:**
- Do you find something unlogical?
- What you liked/disliked?
- What do you think is too complicated?
- Overall opinion?
